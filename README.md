## Introduction

Health Disease Prediction and Detection is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes and help healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. This project aims to utilize machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of various diseases and detect abnormalities in medical images.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of different health diseases based on patient data.
  
- **Image Detection**: Implement deep learning models for the detection of diseases in medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive user interface for easy interaction and interpretation of results.

- **Scalability**: Ensure that the models are scalable and can handle a large volume of data for real-world applications.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
